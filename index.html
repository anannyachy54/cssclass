            <p>
                Music is the art of arranging sounds in time 
                through the elements of melody,
                 harmony, rhythm, and timbre.
                 Music is a protean art; it lends itself easily to alliances with words,
                  as in song, and with physical movement, as in dance.
                   Throughout history,
                  music has been an important adjunct to ritual and drama and has been credited with
                   the capacity to reflect and influence human emotion.</p>
